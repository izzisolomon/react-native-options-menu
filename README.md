# react-native-options-menu
A native looking options dialog for IOS, and Android and Web.

To Download, run: yarn add react-native-options-menu, or npm install -s react-native-options-menu.

Usage example: 

    import OptionsMenu from "react-native-options-menu";
    const MoreIcon = require("../../assets/more/more.png");

    <OptionsMenu
      button={MoreIcon}
      buttonStyle={{ width: 32, height: 8, margin: 7.5, resizeMode: "contain" }}
      destructiveIndex={1}
      options={["Edit", "Delete", "Cancel"]}
      actions={[this.editPost, this.deletePost]}/>
                           
                           
Note that button is a required prop (pass in a png of the desired button).

As an alternative to the button and style props, you can just pass in a full custom component: 


    const myIcon = (<Icon name="rocket" size={30} color="#900" />)
    <OptionsMenu
      customButton={myIcon}
      destructiveIndex={1}
      options={["Edit", "Delete", "Cancel"]}
      actions={[this.editPost, this.deletePost]}/>


Destructive index in an iOS only prop. It will appear as a red index. 

Options: an array of strings that will be displayed in the menu.

Actions: an array of functions to be executed for every menu item. Note that the orders of options an actions have to match.

By default the component used to handle the menu triggering is a `TouchableOpacity`, that can be changed by using the `renderTriggerComponent` prop, where you can pass a function responsible to render the trigger component, that function must receive the following parameters `children`, `ref`, `onPress`, and return the Component.
